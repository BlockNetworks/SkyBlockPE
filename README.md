# SkyBlockPE
SkyBlock ported to PocketMine, API 1.12.0 +

This plugin is an edit of MyPlot with a new generator and different commands.

ToDo:
 - quests and rewards
 - Configuration for exact island size, currently based on chunks
 - rewrite the generator
 - reset island fix
 - dispose/clear island fix
 - setspawn bug
 - spawn chests at correct position

Notes

This plugin was coded and is maintained by thebigsmileXD of the Imagical Corporation. This is not a plugin for everyone, this is a plugin for our intended use. Hopefully you find it useful too.
